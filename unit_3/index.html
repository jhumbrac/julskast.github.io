	<h3>Jeans That Fit</h3>
	<p>We've put thought into our jeans design to make sure they fit and flatter as many women as possible.  Most jeans are made too tight at the hips and thighs, gap at the back, and are cut too low to look sophisticated. Without losing our stylish, youthful look, our jeans are designed to actually fit the most common body shapes at each jeans size.</p>
